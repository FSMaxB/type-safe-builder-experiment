Type Safe Builder Pattern
=========================

This is an experiment to explore the idea of a type safe builder pattern.

Essentially the idea is to have a builder that checks if all the necessary properties have been provided at compile time.
If any are missing, the program should not compile.

Bonus: Try to make the implementation as efficient (runtime + memory) as possible.
